        <h3>Ijen Crater</h3>
        <h2>East Java, Indonesia</h2>

        <p>The Ijen volcano complex is a group of composite volcanoes located on the border between Banyuwangi Regency and Bondowoso Regency of East Java, Indonesia.
          It is inside an eponymous larger caldera Ijen, which is about 20 kilometres (12 mi) wide. The Gunung Merapi stratovolcano is the highest point of that complex. The name "Gunung Merapi" means 'mountain of fire' in the Indonesian language; Mount Merapi in central Java and Marapi in Sumatra have the same etymology.</p>    
        <br>
          <img class="dest-desc-bdy lord" src="../assets/photos/Ijen Crater/1 (5).jpg" alt="" style="width:100%" height="450">
        <br>
        <p>Many other post-caldera cones and craters are located within the caldera or along its rim. The largest concentration of post-caldera cones run east–west across the southern side of the caldera. The active crater at Kawah Ijen has a diameter of 722 metres (2,369 ft) and a surface area of 0.41 square kilometres (0.16 sq mi). It is 200 metres (660 ft) deep and has a volume of 36 cubic hectometres (29,000 acre⋅ft).
          The lake is recognised as the largest highly acidic crater lake in the world.[1] It is also a source for the river Banyupahit, resulting in highly acidic and metal-enriched river water which has a significant detrimental effect on the downstream river ecosystem.[5] On July 14–15, 2008, explorer George Kourounis took a small rubber boat out onto the acid lake to measure its acidity. The pH of the water in the lake's edges was measured to be 0.5 and in the middle of the lake 0.13 due to a high concentration of sulfuric acid.[6]</p>

        <h4>Blue Fire</h4>
        <p>Since National Geographic mentioned the electric-blue flame of Ijen, tourist numbers have increased.[7] The phenomenon has occurred for a long time, but beforehand there was no midnight hiking. A two-hour hike is required to reach the rim of the crater, followed by a 45-minute hike down to the bank of the crater. The blue fire is ignited sulfuric gas, which emerges from cracks at temperatures up to 600 °C (1,112 °F).
          The flames can be up to five meters (16 feet) high; some of the gas condenses to liquid and is still ignited.[8][9] It is the largest blue flame area in the world and local people refer to it as Api Biru (Blue Fire).[10] The other location at which the blue fire can be seen is in Dallol mountain, Ethiopia.[11]</p>

        <br>
        <h4>How to get there</h4>
        <p>There are 2 main ways to get to Kawah Ijen: via Bali or via Surabaya. Both routes take about the same time. The route from Surabaya involves less changes (no boat).
          Via Bali:  you can reach Kawah Ijen from Bali (but this means combining taxis and boat).  From Bali, we won’t go into details but you need to fly to Denpasar and then take a car for 3 to 4 hours to reach Gilimanuk Ferry Port (western tip of Bali), then take a ferry for 1 hour to reach Ketapang Ferry Port in Banyuwangi. You can then either stay there and leave early in the morning to go to the Ijen or take another car and stay closer to the Ijen.

                              <p>Indonesia is the largest archipelago in the world. It consists of five major islands and about 30 smaller groups. There are total number of 17,508 islands of which about 6000 are inhabited. Straddling equator, the archipelago is on a crossroads between two oceans, the Pacific and the Indian Ocean, and bridges two continents, Asia and Australia. Indonesia has many high mountains, the highest of which are over 4000 metres. Many of them are active volcanoes. There are tropical rainforests and jungles, as well as swampy mangrove areas. Indonesia’s most fertile land is on the island of Java.</p>

                              <p>Indonesia is a vast equatorial archipeago of 17,000 islands extending 5,150 kilometers (3,200 miles) east to west, between the Indian and Pacific Oceans in Southeast Asia. The largest islands are Sumatra, Java, Kalimantan (Indonesian Borneo), Sulawesi, and the Indonesian part of New Guinea (known as Papua or Irian Jaya). Islands are mountainous with dense rain forests, and some have active volcanoes. Most of the smaller islands belong to larger groups, like the Moluccas (Spice Islands).</p>
                              <br>
                              <p>The territory of the Republic of Indonesia stretches from 6°08′ N latitude to 11°15′ S latitude, and from 94°45′ E to 141°05′ E longitude. Total Area of Indonesia is 1,919,440 sq km (Land Area: 1,826,440 sq km; Water Area: 93,000 sq km). The five main islands are: Sumatra (473,606 sq. km); the most fertile and densely populated islands, Java/Madura (132,107 sq. km); Kalimantan, which comprises two-thirds of the island of Borneo (539,460 sq km); Sulawesi (189,216 sq km); and Irian Jaya (421,981 sq km), which is part of the world’s second largest island, New Guinea. Indonesia’s other islands are smaller in size.</p>

                              <p>The extreme variations in rainfall are linked with the monsoons. Generally speaking, there is a dry season (June to September), and a rainy season (December to March). Western and northern parts of Indonesia experience the most precipitation, since the north- and westward-moving monsoon clouds are heavy with moisture by the time they reach these more distant regions. Western Sumatra, Java, Bali, the interiors of Kalimantan, Sulawesi, and Irian Jaya are the most predictably damp regions of Indonesia, with rainfall measuring more than 2,000 millimeters per year.</p>

Probably this is due to the relative strength of the earth's gravitational energy."  On that last text their leader-writer expanded very comfortingly.</p>
