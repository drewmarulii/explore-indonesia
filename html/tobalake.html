        <h3>Lake Toba</h3>
        <h2>North Sumatera, Indonesia</h2>

        <p>Lake Toba (Indonesian: Danau Toba) is a large natural lake in North Sumatra, Indonesia, occupying the caldera of a supervolcano. 
        The lake is located in the middle of the northern part of the island of Sumatra, 
        with a surface elevation of about 900 metres (2,953 ft), the lake stretches from 2.88°N 98.52°E to 2.35°N 99.1°E. 
        The lake is about 100 kilometres (62 miles) long, 30 kilometres (19 mi) wide, and up to 505 metres (1,657 ft) deep. 
        It is the largest lake in Indonesia and the largest volcanic lake in the world. Lake Toba Caldera is one of the twenty Geoparks in Indonesia, 
        which is recognised in July 2020 as one of the UNESCO Global Geopark</p>

        <br>
        <h4>People</h4>
        <p>Most of the people who live around Lake Toba are ethnically Bataks. Traditional Batak houses are noted for their distinctive roofs 
        (which curve upwards at each end, as a boat's hull does) and their colorful decor.</p>     
        <br>
        <h4>Transportation</h4>
        <p>Parapat town is located on the edge of the lake, which is the transit point to travel the lake and Samosir Island. 
          Medan is about 173 km by road from the town and connected via Trans-Sumatran Highway to Pematang Siantar by a 48 km road. 
          Sisingamangaraja XII International Airport is located about 47 mi (76 km) distance from Parapat town.</p>

        <br>
        <h4>Flora & Fauna</h4>
        <p>The flora of the lake includes various types of phytoplankton, emerged macrophytes, floating macrophytes, and submerged macrophytes, while the surrounding countryside is rainforest including areas of Sumatran tropical pine forests on the higher mountainsides.
          The fauna includes several species of zooplankton and benthic animals. Since the lake is oligotrophic (nutrient-poor), 
          the native fish fauna is relatively scarce, and the only endemics are Rasbora tobana (strictly speaking near-endemic, 
          since also found in some tributary rivers that run into the lake) and Neolissochilus thienemanni, locally known as the Batak fish.

                              <p>Indonesia is the largest archipelago in the world. It consists of five major islands and about 30 smaller groups. There are total number of 17,508 islands of which about 6000 are inhabited. Straddling equator, the archipelago is on a crossroads between two oceans, the Pacific and the Indian Ocean, and bridges two continents, Asia and Australia. Indonesia has many high mountains, the highest of which are over 4000 metres. Many of them are active volcanoes. There are tropical rainforests and jungles, as well as swampy mangrove areas. Indonesia’s most fertile land is on the island of Java.</p>

                              <p>Indonesia is a vast equatorial archipeago of 17,000 islands extending 5,150 kilometers (3,200 miles) east to west, between the Indian and Pacific Oceans in Southeast Asia. The largest islands are Sumatra, Java, Kalimantan (Indonesian Borneo), Sulawesi, and the Indonesian part of New Guinea (known as Papua or Irian Jaya). Islands are mountainous with dense rain forests, and some have active volcanoes. Most of the smaller islands belong to larger groups, like the Moluccas (Spice Islands).</p>
                              <br>
                              <p>The territory of the Republic of Indonesia stretches from 6°08′ N latitude to 11°15′ S latitude, and from 94°45′ E to 141°05′ E longitude. Total Area of Indonesia is 1,919,440 sq km (Land Area: 1,826,440 sq km; Water Area: 93,000 sq km). The five main islands are: Sumatra (473,606 sq. km); the most fertile and densely populated islands, Java/Madura (132,107 sq. km); Kalimantan, which comprises two-thirds of the island of Borneo (539,460 sq km); Sulawesi (189,216 sq km); and Irian Jaya (421,981 sq km), which is part of the world’s second largest island, New Guinea. Indonesia’s other islands are smaller in size.</p>

                              <p>The extreme variations in rainfall are linked with the monsoons. Generally speaking, there is a dry season (June to September), and a rainy season (December to March). Western and northern parts of Indonesia experience the most precipitation, since the north- and westward-moving monsoon clouds are heavy with moisture by the time they reach these more distant regions. Western Sumatra, Java, Bali, the interiors of Kalimantan, Sulawesi, and Irian Jaya are the most predictably damp regions of Indonesia, with rainfall measuring more than 2,000 millimeters per year.</p>
